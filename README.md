"A constructed writing system or a neography is a writing system specifically created by an individual or group, rather than having evolved as part of a language or culture like a natural script."

### Note

This repo is mainly for personal showcasing purpose.

#### Formetta

Formetta consists of clear, simple and very easy to reproduce / memorize symbols. It can be used to write English, and other languages.

The goal was to have a script that was easy to write everywhere, being it a comfortable or uncomfortable situation, using either writing tools or anything sharp.

NOTE: A simpler version of Formetta, called FormettaSimple, does not distinguish between upper and lower cases and just keep the "!" as a punctuation sign (others remains the same).

##### Notable features

- Type of writing system: alphabet
- Direction of writing: left to right in horizontal lines
- Used to write: English

#### ContinuumScript

ContinuumScript consists of symbols designed to always be able to link one with another. It can be used to write English, and other languages.

The script is meant to be memorized and used smoothly to quickly be able to write without detaching the pen from the paper.
